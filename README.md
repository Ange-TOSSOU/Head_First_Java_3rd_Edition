# Head First Java: A Learner's Guide to Real-World Programming, 3rd Edition by Kathy Sierra, Bert Bates and Trisha Gee

This book aim to dicover the world of Java, as wide as possible, wether you are a beginner or not.

I create this repo to store all my solutions for code challenges proposed in the book. Feel free to take a look and give me your feedback.
